# Warehouse Autobot Pathfinding

## Overview

This project simulates autonomous bots navigating a warehouse grid using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The bots can detect obstacles, avoid collisions, and find the shortest path to their destination. The graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter allows users to define bot start and end positions, obstacles, and view the command log of bot movements.

## Features

- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Utilizes the A* algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Dynamically handles collisions between bots by waiting or recalculating paths.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive interface for setting up the grid, defining bot positions, and viewing logs.
- **Configurable Grid Size**: Users can specify the grid size at runtime.
- **Obstacle Handling**: Users can place obstacles on the grid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run the main script:

```bash
python last.py
